# Osprey Service

Provides functions for the cross-platform Osprey GUI that can't be run
directly on client computers, usually due to unsupported operating systems.


## Dependencies

Osprey Service needs a Java runtime (v8+) and a fortran runtime.

To install on Ubuntu (or other Debian-based linux):
```shell
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless, libgfortran-7-dev
```
